# manjornio

Manjorno or Manjornio is inspired by the meal kit provider Hello Fresh.

I wanted to build some real world project that actually can be used and
can solve a problem.

The final product will be an Web Application that looks like a E-commerce,
but with a little bit difference in the logic behind as you have a product
which contains certain amount of differend subproducts.

The plan is to build the whole project with views and templates although
will be an API in the end. I think I will learn even more that way.
